China's National Development and Reform Commission is calling for stable property market policies tailored to different cities and demands. Premier Li Qiang chaired a State Council meeting to introduce new policies for economic recovery and optimize real estate regulations. The emphasis is on steady and healthy development in the property market. However, no large-scale stimulus was announced, and the focus remains on removing consumption restrictions and improving infrastructure.","China's National Development and Reform Commission is calling for stable property market policies tailored to different cities and demands.

Hello Troy – 

When I was requested for the UCA’s they mentioned the temperatures, so I ran them at those temps. For the 15.6ppg, 14.0ppg they Cliff requested at 125degF, and for the 12.0ppg Andy Swint requested 120degF. However, at 125degF we achieve the requested compressive strength, I honestly do not think that there will be much of a significant difference in compressive strength at 140degF. It may just give us a few PSI higher since it is a bit warmer.","Hello Troy –

""""As the smoke of Lucky Strike twirled around in shifting patterns, I sat on the edge of the drum riser. The crash cymbal trembled, as if to mourn our dear departed rhythm guitarist, Griffin Tiploft. With equal parts suspicion, curiosity, and mischief in our souls, we had parted ways with him, the man seemingly fond of secretive glances and hushed conversations.

Not that Les Orthogonaux were under any delusion of complete innocence. Our ever-so-acerbic tunes never failed to question the establishment, discarding subtle suggestions in favor of outright belligerence. But as with all things in life, perhaps we flew too close to the sun with our feathers clipped to pieces. The quiet Griffin had become a genuine enigma, and perhaps a threat.

Now, Otto Loosli, stoic and unbreakable, gave me “the look.” His fingers danced across his lead guitar’s fretboard, trapeze artists in a far-off circus tent. Next to him stood Reza Fazekas, who brought both sleaze and skill to our little communion, his bass grooving to an imaginary rhythm while he strummed his sitar, a snake charmer to our dormant rebellion.

The doorway creaked, and Reza pushed in a dramatic entrance. Between his fingers danced the wheels of a chair. “Voilá! Gentlemen,” Reza declared, “meet our brand new pianist!”

Seated in the wheelchair, a captivating figure, marred beauty glowing like a firefly in the smoky dimness. Burnt out wings in the form of scars decorated her face, and she clung nervously to a scarf, concealing a ghastly reminder of tragedy around her neck.

“Anneliese Ehn,” Reza proudly introduced her, “ye-ye extraordinaire!”

I furrowed my brow, lost for words as I tried to piece together this unsolved enigma. Yet, Otto appeared to be right at home, his pedantic predilections painting a vivid memory in his mind. “Ah, Anneliese,” he murmured. “The chanteuse who suffered a terrible accident not too long ago, wasn’t it? The one where you…

She nodded, her eyes lowering behind her silken veil. “Yes, that’s… that’s me.” Her gaze shifted to the keys of a nearby piano. “But that hasn’t stopped me from playing, nor has it stolen my voice.”

As Anneliese trilled an ethereal siren’s call, I couldn’t help but wonder what had brought her and Reza together. I could see the undeniable attraction between them, and a pang of envy stroked my weary heart.

“Enough of the tragic opera,” Otto declared, his business-like demeanor shining through. “Tell us, Anneliese, what ideas do you have for Les Orthogonaux?”

With a secure grip on her scarf, she grinned, and for one ephemeral moment, I could glimpse the radiant beauty that once captivated the world. “Gentlemen,” she said, pausing for just the right dramatic effect, “I have a plan.”

So there would be life after Griffin; the stage would fill again with the freakbeat virtuosos. Les Orthogonaux would rise, and perhaps, under Anneliese’s scarred yet luminous wings, they might just touch the sun one more time.

My hands danced a waltz upon the drumheads. I was intoxicated by the atmosphere that now pulsed with Anneliese’s presence. The smoke swam through the room, wrapping her figure in a diaphanous haze. Every beat I drummed was for her, every crash a resounding echo of my growing obsession.

Otto’s keen eyes seemed to sense my torment. His voice interrupted my rhythmic longing, “Hey Marcel, loosen the grip on those drumsticks, will you? You’ll break them, or your knuckles, at this rate.”

With a sheepish laugh, I slackened my hold on the drumsticks, freeing the captive blood flow. “You know me, Otto, thunder comes naturally.”

As I sat there, I couldn’t get Anneliese out of my head. From the corner of my eye, I spotted her silhouette, as if tattooed in black ink on the dimly lit wall. Her scars glowed, a constellation of tragedy and resilience intertwined.

She sat demurely, her laughter tinting the air in a pleasant hue as Reza basked under the enchanting spell of her charm. Anneliese’s every lilting word seemed to pierce me, chipping away at the walls around my heart.

Otto chuckled, “Don’t you ever tire of walking in circles like a caged lion, Marcel?”

Relentless, my thoughts weaved a dizzying pattern of obsession, and with each step, I traced the unseen threads that bound me to Anneliese. I paced and circled, like a desperate creature, unable to cage the swarm of bees buzzing in my mind.

Her every gesture, the tilt of her head, and the enigmatic curve of her scars, all conspired against me. My old friend, melancholia, nestled warmly in my heart, expanding and pulsating with every glance I stole at her.

Suddenly, the swirling vortex of emotion gave birth to a concept. In my haunted mind, a song began to form, words and music entwining in a chaotic embrace. I approached Otto, my voice barely a whisper as I broached the idea.

“Otto, I have a song.”, I nervously confessed. “It’s about Anneliese.”

His eyes flickered, sensing the gravity of the moment. “Is it about the scars? The lust? The tragic dalliance between broken souls and serenades?” he inquired, his stoicism momentarily replaced by a lyrical fascination.

“All of that and more,” I replied, gripping my drumsticks tightly, ready to unleash the inner storm upon this veil of silence.

“Well, let’s hear it then, maestro,” Otto said, as a smirk played on his lips, his eyes gesturing towards Anneliese, whose attention remained devoted to a smirking Reza, beguiling snake charmer.

Blood rushed to my face as I hesitated, caught between my desire to whisper my love and my wounded pride. Perhaps Anneliese would never see me, the drummer in the shadows, beating a pulse that craved her attention.

But today, I would lay down the rhythm, the verse that would set the stage for our twisted love story, a monument to whispered confessions, invisible scars, and the relentless pursuit of desire.""""","""""As the smoke of Lucky Strike twirled around in shifting patterns, I sat on the edge of the drum riser.

Introduction\n\nIn today's fast-paced and ever-changing beverage alcohol market landscape, creating seamless integration between eCommerce and traditional sales teams is increasingly vital. At Breakthru Beverage Group, our most critical sales tool is and always will be our sales force. The essence of our strategy revolves around feeding insights from our proprietary eCommerce tool, BREAKTHRU NOW, to our sales team and allowing them to become more consultative partners to their accounts rather than just order takers.\n\n1: How Best-in-Class Companies Utilize eCommerce Insights\n\nBest-in-class companies recognize the importance of harmonizing eCommerce insights with their sales force. The strategies we leverage at Breakthru include:\n\n    Real-time Data Sharing: Utilizing our robust customer data and tools ensures that the sales team receives up-to-the-minute information on our customers' online behavior. This allows for rapid response and customization according to customer needs.\n    Customer Behavior Analysis: Understanding online purchasing behavior will enable sales representatives to tailor their sales pitches, offer personalized solutions, and enhance the overall customer experience.\n    Collaborative Planning: We incorporate insights from eCommerce to target specific accounts during sales campaigns, adjust strategies to reflect market trends, and foster synergy between online and offline sales.\n\n2: Evolving the Role of the Sales Team\n\nShifting Breakthru sales representatives from order-taking to a more consultative role has been proven to save time and increase sales effectiveness. This evolution leads to:\n\n    Enhanced Customer Engagement: Sales representatives become trusted advisors rather than just product sellers. They engage customers in meaningful dialogue and provide insights tailored to each client's unique needs. This isn't always a natural change and needs to be taught as a best practice from the moment new reps join the company and reinforced throughout their tenure.\n    Greater Focus on Strategic Accounts: Free from more routine tasks, the sales team can concentrate on building and nurturing strategic relationships, ultimately driving more significant revenue growth, especially with our most critical customers.\n    Increased Cross-Selling Opportunities: By understanding customer preferences from eCommerce data, sales teams can cross-sell relevant products, adding value to customer relationships. Through our sales rep recommendation tool, sales reps can also engage with customers through BREAKTHRU NOW and directly suggest products they should purchase, including applicable pricing and deals.\n\n3: Optimizing Sales Across B2B eCommerce, Sales Teams, and Inside Sales\n\nBest-in-class B2B companies can enhance sales across order channels through:\n\n    Data Sharing Across Platforms: Unifying customer interaction data from eCommerce, sales teams, and inside sales ensures consistency and creates a comprehensive view of customers, leading to better decision-making.\n    Insight-Driven Segmentation: Segmenting accounts based on specific attributes and purchasing history allows for targeted marketing and sales efforts, improving conversion rates, and maximizing return on investment.\n    Empowering Inside Sales through Technology: Implementing integrated sales solutions that share eCommerce insights can enhance the efficiency of inside sales, aligning them with overall company goals.\n\nConclusion\n\nLeveraging eCommerce data to benefit the sales team isn't just about merging two channels. It's about building a cohesive ecosystem where data, insights, and human expertise come together to create a superior sales strategy. At Breakthru, we firmly believe in leveraging these principles to win across all channels of sale, enhancing our position as the leader in our markets and making us a better connector between our supplier and customer partners.","Introduction\n\nIn today's fast-paced and ever-changing beverage alcohol market landscape, creating seamless integration between eCommerce and traditional sales teams is increasingly vital.

Daphne was a Naiad Nymph in Greek Mythology, the daughter of a river god. She was famous for being incredibly beautiful and for catching the eye of god Apollo. However, Daphne was determined to remain unmarried and untouched by a man for the rest of her life. According to Greek Mythology, Apollo had been mocking the God of Love, Eros. In retaliation, Eros fired two arrows: a golden arrow that struck Apollo and made him madly in love with Daphne, and a lead arrow that made Daphne hate Apollo.","Daphne was a Naiad Nymph in Greek Mythology, the daughter of a river god.

Hello, Miguel,

so sorry for the late message but I just heard from Nick that you might be in need of some extra help at the Beach club this upcoming Wednesday. I'd really appreciate it if you considered me for this. Since we're going to have to leave relatively soon, every extra hour means a lot.

The chip shortage we see today is a result of relationships between Taiwan, China, and the United states. Taiwan used to be our factory, but with China constantly pressuring Taiwan, combined with our fear of China’s nuclear and hypersonic missiles, the Biden administration decided to pass the CHIPS act, which not only limited semiconductor equipment sales to China, but it also gave subsidies to domestic manufacturing facilities. Later, Congress also passed the FABS act, which helped companies recover from the Chips act, that limited revenue to big buyers in China, by giving these companies tax cuts. These boosts to the economy are not enough, as we are still seeing a mass inflation in consumer microchips, which is why graphics cards and CPUs are still priced 2 times as much as usual. Microchips are immensely functional, and we are heavily reliant on them. Microchips are the future, and these two global superpowers, China and the US, are fighting over dominance over microchips, for uses like Ai, Weapons, and Rockets.","The chip shortage we see today is a result of relationships between Taiwan, China, and the United states.

We conducted a trial to assess whether a ctDNA-guided approach could reduce the use of adjuvant chemotherapy without compromising recurrence risk. Patients with stage II colon cancer were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to have treatment decisions guided by either ctDNA results or standard clinicopathological features. For ctDNA-guided management, a ctDNA-positive result at 4 or 7 weeks after surgery prompted oxaliplatin-based or fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy. Patients who were ctDNA-negative were not treated. The primary efficacy end point was recurrence-free survival at 2 years. A key secondary end point was adjuvant chemotherapy use.","We conducted a trial to assess whether a ctDNA-guided approach could reduce the use of adjuvant chemotherapy without compromising recurrence risk.

In the novel “The Hunger Games” the plot is centred around the main character Katniss’s determination to protect her sister which she loves. Katniss’s determination to protect her sister is most evident in that quote ““I volunteer!” I gasp. “I volunteer as tribute!””(Collins, Page 22). Katniss’s reasoning for volunteering was because she was determined to protect her sister who had been picked for the Hunger Games by taking her place and sacrificing herself.","In the novel “The Hunger Games” the plot is centred around the main character Katniss’s determination to protect her sister which she loves.

Archaeologists claim that the ancestors of American Indians made their way to the new world via a land connection across the Bering Sea. Now anthropologist Jefferey Goodman disputes this land-bridge hypothesis. A migration across the northernmost land would have been such an important event in their history. Goodman says, that American Indian mythology about their origins would refer to a great journey. This myth does not exist. “Conspicuously missing in all the known myths are any stories that bear the slightest resemblance to the notation of a Bearing route; none seem to describe an arduous journey from Asia across the snow and ice of the north.”","Archaeologists claim that the ancestors of American Indians made their way to the new world via a land connection across the Bering Sea.

One must be frank about the state of the art for models that capture syntax. It’s not that large language models offer slightly higher performance than other approaches in linguistics; its not that they better cover some corners of syntax. It’s that there is nothing comparable in all of linguistic theory to the power of large language models in both syntax and semantics—much less discourse coherence, style, pragmatics, translation, meta-linguistic awareness, non-linguistic tasks, etc. They are game changers on all fronts.","One must be frank about the state of the art for models that capture syntax.

"초보자에게 설명하자면, 이 개념은 무엇이며 무엇을 말하려고 하는지:
Try to imagine a creation myth in which everything in existence - you and all your experiences, all conscious beings and all their experiences, the universe and all if its experiences and all its infinite elements, everything from spacetime itself to subatomic particles to chemicals to birds to planets to stars and galaxies, the entire sea of infinity we think we live in - is all merely the finite and fleeting song of a bird. This bird exists beyond our spacetime, so it might be better to call it a hyperbird. In order to attract a mate and reproduce, it sings its song, which is our existence. According to both bleeding-edge science and ancient teachings, we can only perceive illusion when we use our senses to try to grasp reality. This is because the focus of evolution is survival and reproduction, and we are a product of evolution. If an organism sees truth, it lacks the ability to survive and reproduce. If an organism is successful at survival and reproduction, it cannot see truth. The more resources we put into survival and reproduction, the less truth we can see. Perhaps even the super-intelligent hyperbird would not be able to see truth. Language and our thoughts themselves are products of evolution. Just like the hyperbird's song - our reality - our own words and thoughts seek to survive, replicate themselves, and evolve. Try to sit for one hour without speaking and thinking. All sorts of thoughts will pop into your head; the more you try to not think, the more you think. These inner words and thoughts are trying to use your awareness as a medium to survive, replicate and evolve. Given enough time they will evolve into universes too. Do you let them evolve into new worlds?","Try to imagine a creation myth in which everything in existence - you and all your experiences, all conscious beings and all their experiences, the universe and all if its experiences and all its infinite elements, everything from spacetime itself to subatomic particles to chemicals to birds to planets to stars and galaxies, the entire sea of infinity we think we live in - is all merely the finite and fleeting song of a bird.

The incident occurred during the break at Sunday’s 2-0 win over Iceland.
But with Portugal struggling to take their chances in the first half to enter the Euro Cup, players gathered in the tunnel for a pep talk before heading back onto the pitch.
Manchester United captain Fernandes and Man City defender Ruben Dias could be seen engaged in a tense discussion as teammates watched on.
One of those taking it all in was national team skipper Ronaldo, who now plies his trade in Saudi Arabia with Al-Nassr.
But the legendary striker appeared bemused while watching Fernandes and Dias’ conversation.
And Ronaldo turned on his heels while bearing a wry grin as he walked out of the tunnel and onto the field.
Supporters were quick to take note of his body language and facial expression, with many reckoning Ronnie is yearning for the old days of international football.One said: “You can see the goat misses the old generation.
“Diogo Dalot and Otavio are probably the only two from this generation that Cristiano is close with.
“We need Pepe back too, he is a REAL one!”
Another declared: “Man is lost listening.”
One added: “Bruno believes himself to be the captain.”
But Portugal boss Martinez downplayed any talk of Ronaldo being unsettled, saying: ""Cristiano Ronaldo is as hungry as an 18-year-old player. He is a role model, he always tries to be in the right position and is looking for the goal.""","The incident occurred during the break at Sunday’s 2-0 win over Iceland.
