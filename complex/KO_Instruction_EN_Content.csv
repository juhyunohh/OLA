To say that the thoughts which it instils into the mind of the woman were on the serpent’s part not evil, but only extremely sagacious, and became sin first in the human consciousness (so Merx, Di. al.), is hardly in accordance with the spirit of the narrative.

When I was requested for the UCA’s they mentioned the temperatures, so I ran them at those temps. For the 15.6ppg, 14.0ppg they Cliff requested at 125degF, and for the 12.0ppg Andy Swint requested 120degF. However, at 125degF we achieve the requested compressive strength, I honestly do not think that there will be much of a significant difference in compressive strength at 140degF. It may just give us a few PSI higher since it is a bit warmer.","Hello Troy –

We conducted a trial to assess whether a ctDNA-guided approach could reduce the use of adjuvant chemotherapy without compromising recurrence risk. Patients with stage II colon cancer were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to have treatment decisions guided by either ctDNA results or standard clinicopathological features. For ctDNA-guided management, a ctDNA-positive result at 4 or 7 weeks after surgery prompted oxaliplatin-based or fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy. Patients who were ctDNA-negative were not treated. The primary efficacy end point was recurrence-free survival at 2 years. A key secondary end point was adjuvant chemotherapy use.","We conducted a trial to assess whether a ctDNA-guided approach could reduce the use of adjuvant chemotherapy without compromising recurrence risk.

Archaeologists claim that the ancestors of American Indians made their way to the new world via a land connection across the Bering Sea. Now anthropologist Jefferey Goodman disputes this land-bridge hypothesis. A migration across the northernmost land would have been such an important event in their history. Goodman says, that American Indian mythology about their origins would refer to a great journey. This myth does not exist. “Conspicuously missing in all the known myths are any stories that bear the slightest resemblance to the notation of a Bearing route; none seem to describe an arduous journey from Asia across the snow and ice of the north.”","Archaeologists claim that the ancestors of American Indians made their way to the new world via a land connection across the Bering Sea.

The chip shortage we see today is a result of relationships between Taiwan, China, and the United states. Taiwan used to be our factory, but with China constantly pressuring Taiwan, combined with our fear of China’s nuclear and hypersonic missiles, the Biden administration decided to pass the CHIPS act, which not only limited semiconductor equipment sales to China, but it also gave subsidies to domestic manufacturing facilities. Later, Congress also passed the FABS act, which helped companies recover from the Chips act, that limited revenue to big buyers in China, by giving these companies tax cuts. These boosts to the economy are not enough, as we are still seeing a mass inflation in consumer microchips, which is why graphics cards and CPUs are still priced 2 times as much as usual.

""""As the smoke of Lucky Strike twirled around in shifting patterns, I sat on the edge of the drum riser. The crash cymbal trembled, as if to mourn our dear departed rhythm guitarist, Griffin Tiploft. With equal parts suspicion, curiosity, and mischief in our souls, we had parted ways with him, the man seemingly fond of secretive glances and hushed conversations.

Not that Les Orthogonaux were under any delusion of complete innocence. Our ever-so-acerbic tunes never failed to question the establishment, discarding subtle suggestions in favor of outright belligerence. But as with all things in life, perhaps we flew too close to the sun with our feathers clipped to pieces. The quiet Griffin had become a genuine enigma, and perhaps a threat.

Now, Otto Loosli, stoic and unbreakable, gave me “the look.” His fingers danced across his lead guitar’s fretboard, trapeze artists in a far-off circus tent. Next to him stood Reza Fazekas, who brought both sleaze and skill to our little communion, his bass grooving to an imaginary rhythm while he strummed his sitar, a snake charmer to our dormant rebellion.

The doorway creaked, and Reza pushed in a dramatic entrance. Between his fingers danced the wheels of a chair. “Voilá! Gentlemen,” Reza declared, “meet our brand new pianist!”

Seated in the wheelchair, a captivating figure, marred beauty glowing like a firefly in the smoky dimness. Burnt out wings in the form of scars decorated her face, and she clung nervously to a scarf, concealing a ghastly reminder of tragedy around her neck.

“Anneliese Ehn,” Reza proudly introduced her, “ye-ye extraordinaire!”

I furrowed my brow, lost for words as I tried to piece together this unsolved enigma. Yet, Otto appeared to be right at home, his pedantic predilections painting a vivid memory in his mind. “Ah, Anneliese,” he murmured. “The chanteuse who suffered a terrible accident not too long ago, wasn’t it? The one where you…

She nodded, her eyes lowering behind her silken veil. “Yes, that’s… that’s me.” Her gaze shifted to the keys of a nearby piano. “But that hasn’t stopped me from playing, nor has it stolen my voice.”

As Anneliese trilled an ethereal siren’s call, I couldn’t help but wonder what had brought her and Reza together. I could see the undeniable attraction between them, and a pang of envy stroked my weary heart.

“Enough of the tragic opera,” Otto declared, his business-like demeanor shining through. “Tell us, Anneliese, what ideas do you have for Les Orthogonaux?”

With a secure grip on her scarf, she grinned, and for one ephemeral moment, I could glimpse the radiant beauty that once captivated the world. “Gentlemen,” she said, pausing for just the right dramatic effect, “I have a plan.”

So there would be life after Griffin; the stage would fill again with the freakbeat virtuosos. Les Orthogonaux would rise, and perhaps, under Anneliese’s scarred yet luminous wings, they might just touch the sun one more time.

My hands danced a waltz upon the drumheads. I was intoxicated by the atmosphere that now pulsed with Anneliese’s presence. The smoke swam through the room, wrapping her figure in a diaphanous haze. Every beat I drummed was for her, every crash a resounding echo of my growing obsession.

Otto’s keen eyes seemed to sense my torment. His voice interrupted my rhythmic longing, “Hey Marcel, loosen the grip on those drumsticks, will you? You’ll break them, or your knuckles, at this rate.”

With a sheepish laugh, I slackened my hold on the drumsticks, freeing the captive blood flow. “You know me, Otto, thunder comes naturally.”

As I sat there, I couldn’t get Anneliese out of my head. From the corner of my eye, I spotted her silhouette, as if tattooed in black ink on the dimly lit wall. Her scars glowed, a constellation of tragedy and resilience intertwined.

She sat demurely, her laughter tinting the air in a pleasant hue as Reza basked under the enchanting spell of her charm. Anneliese’s every lilting word seemed to pierce me, chipping away at the walls around my heart.

Otto chuckled, “Don’t you ever tire of walking in circles like a caged lion, Marcel?”

Relentless, my thoughts weaved a dizzying pattern of obsession, and with each step, I traced the unseen threads that bound me to Anneliese. I paced and circled, like a desperate creature, unable to cage the swarm of bees buzzing in my mind.

Her every gesture, the tilt of her head, and the enigmatic curve of her scars, all conspired against me. My old friend, melancholia, nestled warmly in my heart, expanding and pulsating with every glance I stole at her.

Suddenly, the swirling vortex of emotion gave birth to a concept. In my haunted mind, a song began to form, words and music entwining in a chaotic embrace. I approached Otto, my voice barely a whisper as I broached the idea.

“Otto, I have a song.”, I nervously confessed. “It’s about Anneliese.”

His eyes flickered, sensing the gravity of the moment. “Is it about the scars? The lust? The tragic dalliance between broken souls and serenades?” he inquired, his stoicism momentarily replaced by a lyrical fascination.

“All of that and more,” I replied, gripping my drumsticks tightly, ready to unleash the inner storm upon this veil of silence.

“Well, let’s hear it then, maestro,” Otto said, as a smirk played on his lips, his eyes gesturing towards Anneliese, whose attention remained devoted to a smirking Reza, beguiling snake charmer.

Blood rushed to my face as I hesitated, caught between my desire to whisper my love and my wounded pride. Perhaps Anneliese would never see me, the drummer in the shadows, beating a pulse that craved her attention.

But today, I would lay down the rhythm, the verse that would set the stage for our twisted love story, a monument to whispered confessions, invisible scars, and the relentless pursuit of desire.""""","""""As the smoke of Lucky Strike twirled around in shifting patterns, I sat on the edge of the drum riser.

The doorway creaked, and Reza pushed in a dramatic entrance. Between his fingers danced the wheels of a chair. “Voilá! Gentlemen,” Reza declared, “meet our brand new pianist!”

Seated in the wheelchair, a captivating figure, marred beauty glowing like a firefly in the smoky dimness. Burnt out wings in the form of scars decorated her face, and she clung nervously to a scarf, concealing a ghastly reminder of tragedy around her neck.

“Anneliese Ehn,” Reza proudly introduced her, “ye-ye extraordinaire!”

I furrowed my brow, lost for words as I tried to piece together this unsolved enigma. Yet, Otto appeared to be right at home, his pedantic predilections painting a vivid memory in his mind. “Ah, Anneliese,” he murmured. “The chanteuse who suffered a terrible accident not too long ago, wasn’t it? The one where you…

She nodded, her eyes lowering behind her silken veil. “Yes, that’s… that’s me.” Her gaze shifted to the keys of a nearby piano. “But that hasn’t stopped me from playing, nor has it stolen my voice.”

As Anneliese trilled an ethereal siren’s call, I couldn’t help but wonder what had brought her and Reza together. I could see the undeniable attraction between them, and a pang of envy stroked my weary heart.

“Enough of the tragic opera,” Otto declared, his business-like demeanor shining through. “Tell us, Anneliese, what ideas do you have for Les Orthogonaux?”

With a secure grip on her scarf, she grinned, and for one ephemeral moment, I could glimpse the radiant beauty that once captivated the world. “Gentlemen,” she said, pausing for just the right dramatic effect, “I have a plan.”

So there would be life after Griffin; the stage would fill again with the freakbeat virtuosos. Les Orthogonaux would rise, and perhaps, under Anneliese’s scarred yet luminous wings, they might just touch the sun one more time.

My hands danced a waltz upon the drumheads. I was intoxicated by the atmosphere that now pulsed with Anneliese’s presence. The smoke swam through the room, wrapping her figure in a diaphanous haze. Every beat I drummed was for her, every crash a resounding echo of my growing obsession.

Otto’s keen eyes seemed to sense my torment. His voice interrupted my rhythmic longing, “Hey Marcel, loosen the grip on those drumsticks, will you? You’ll break them, or your knuckles, at this rate.”

With a sheepish laugh, I slackened my hold on the drumsticks, freeing the captive blood flow. “You know me, Otto, thunder comes naturally.”

As I sat there, I couldn’t get Anneliese out of my head. From the corner of my eye, I spotted her silhouette, as if tattooed in black ink on the dimly lit wall. Her scars glowed, a constellation of tragedy and resilience intertwined.

She sat demurely, her laughter tinting the air in a pleasant hue as Reza basked under the enchanting spell of her charm. Anneliese’s every lilting word seemed to pierce me, chipping away at the walls around my heart.

Otto chuckled, “Don’t you ever tire of walking in circles like a caged lion, Marcel?”

Relentless, my thoughts weaved a dizzying pattern of obsession, and with each step, I traced the unseen threads that bound me to Anneliese. I paced and circled, like a desperate creature, unable to cage the swarm of bees buzzing in my mind.

Her every gesture, the tilt of her head, and the enigmatic curve of her scars, all conspired against me. My old friend, melancholia, nestled warmly in my heart, expanding and pulsating with every glance I stole at her.

Suddenly, the swirling vortex of emotion gave birth to a concept. In my haunted mind, a song began to form, words and music entwining in a chaotic embrace. I approached Otto, my voice barely a whisper as I broached the idea.

“Otto, I have a song.”, I nervously confessed. “It’s about Anneliese.”

His eyes flickered, sensing the gravity of the moment. “Is it about the scars? The lust? The tragic dalliance between broken souls and serenades?” he inquired, his stoicism momentarily replaced by a lyrical fascination.

“All of that and more,” I replied, gripping my drumsticks tightly, ready to unleash the inner storm upon this veil of silence.

“Well, let’s hear it then, maestro,” Otto said, as a smirk played on his lips, his eyes gesturing towards Anneliese, whose attention remained devoted to a smirking Reza, beguiling snake charmer.

Blood rushed to my face as I hesitated, caught between my desire to whisper my love and my wounded pride. Perhaps Anneliese would never see me, the drummer in the shadows, beating a pulse that craved her attention.

But today, I would lay down the rhythm, the verse that would set the stage for our twisted love story, a monument to whispered confessions, invisible scars, and the relentless pursuit of desire.""""

In the dim glow of the streetlights, the city seemed like a stage set for the unfolding drama of our lives. I sat alone at a café, watching strangers pass by, each carrying their own secrets and stories. The memory of our former bassist, Jaxon, lingered like a haunting melody. He had been a wild card, unpredictable and magnetic. We had parted ways not with anger, but with a silent understanding that his path diverged from ours. Yet, his absence left an unfilled void, a missing chord in our ensemble.","In the dim glow of the streetlights, the city seemed like a stage set for the unfolding drama of our lives.

The old library was a sanctuary of forgotten tales and whispered secrets. I wandered through its aisles, seeking inspiration among the dusty tomes. Our band, The Velvet Spires, had always been a tapestry of eclectic influences, a fusion of sounds that defied categorization. As I picked up a worn-out volume of poetry, I couldn't help but think of Elara, our enigmatic keyboardist. Her melodies were like spells, weaving magic into our music. Yet, beneath her composed exterior lay a world of mystery and untold stories.","The old library was a sanctuary of forgotten tales and whispered secrets.

The moon hung low in the sky, casting silver shadows across the empty stage. I found myself lost in thoughts of our last performance, the energy and chaos that defined us. Our lead guitarist, Nico, had been the heart of the band, his riffs igniting our souls. But he had disappeared into the night, leaving only echoes of his presence. The band had felt his absence like a phantom limb, a constant reminder of what once was. Now, as I stood in the silence, I pondered what the future held for us.","The moon hung low in the sky, casting silver shadows across the empty stage.

As the rain drummed softly on the rooftop, I lay awake, the night alive with memories. The band had been my family, our music a shared language that transcended words. Our saxophonist, Vivian, had brought a sultry elegance to our sound, her solos a dance of fire and grace. But Vivian had left, chasing her dreams across the ocean, leaving a bittersweet note in our collective heart.

Try to imagine a creation myth in which everything in existence - you and all your experiences, all conscious beings and all their experiences, the universe and all if its experiences and all its infinite elements, everything from spacetime itself to subatomic particles to chemicals to birds to planets to stars and galaxies, the entire sea of infinity we think we live in - is all merely the finite and fleeting song of a bird. This bird exists beyond our spacetime, so it might be better to call it a hyperbird. In order to attract a mate and reproduce, it sings its song, which is our existence. According to both bleeding-edge science and ancient teachings, we can only perceive illusion when we use our senses to try to grasp reality. This is because the focus of evolution is survival and reproduction, and we are a product of evolution. If an organism sees truth, it lacks the ability to survive and reproduce. If an organism is successful at survival and reproduction, it cannot see truth. The more resources we put into survival and reproduction, the less truth we can see. Perhaps even the super-intelligent hyperbird would not be able to see truth. Language and our thoughts themselves are products of evolution. Just like the hyperbird's song - our reality - our own words and thoughts seek to survive, replicate themselves, and evolve. Try to sit for one hour without speaking and thinking. All sorts of thoughts will pop into your head; the more you try to not think, the more you think.

When data reaches the CPU through the main memory, the CPU operates in one of two modes: 1. Read cycle or 2. Write cycle.
In the read cycle, the CPU sends a read request signal to the control bus of the system bus, and the processor transmits the address to the memory through the address bus. The memory then sends the data to the processor via the *data bus*. Finally, the processor sends a completion signal to the control bus as the last step.","When data reaches the CPU through the main memory, the CPU operates in one of two modes: 1. Read cycle or 2.

Your dried lips—

● I’ll adjust the number of files until we reach level 99… Today, I’m uploading 30 files.

The password is the one I shared with you. (I’m a little worried it might be too easy…)

Even if it’s not a post, please leave a comment—even just an emoji—to make sure there’s a trace.

(Just giving a “like” won’t be enough anymore…)

For those who haven’t received the password, please leave comments diligently next week and show some effort.

I’ll upload more files next weekend after the ones I posted today.

Try posting even one shared post, and if you download a file, make sure to leave a comment~~~ (especially for martial arts or fantasy content).

Even if it’s not worth a fortune, there are words and messages that can truly win someone’s heart.

It’s essential in social life—not just in this “rabbit house”—to earn people’s trust and goodwill.

I hope there won’t be anyone requesting the password without showing any effort.","● I’ll adjust the number of files until we reach level 99… Today, I’m uploading 30 files.
